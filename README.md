# README

The assignment was to connect three provided sensors--a button, joystick, and potentiometer--to an ESP32 TTGO Display, and then use that data on a laptop.

This repository includes code to take in the sensor values and then print them to a terminal in 1000 millisecond increments. Also html and javascript code to connect those read values to some meaning, but that was not entirely successful so they are not connected.

It also has stl files for 3D printing an enclosure for the above sensors that looks like a hexbug nano and 2 photos I drew of a hexbug in 2 colorways that would ideally switch from one to the other.
